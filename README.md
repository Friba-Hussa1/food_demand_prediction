# üì¶ Inventory Forecasting for Restaurant Supply Optimization

This project aims to develop a machine learning system that forecasts inventory needs for a restaurant, optimizing purchase orders and reducing waste. The dataset is based on aggregated sales orders prior to each delivery window, which occurs **twice a week: Monday and Saturday**.

## üß† Project Objective

The main goal is to **predict how much of each inventory item will be needed before the next scheduled delivery**, using historical data and advanced machine learning techniques. This enables restaurants to:

- Prevent overstocking or understocking
- Automate ordering decisions
- Improve operational efficiency
